# zendesk-attachments-downloader
Chrome extension to automatically manage downloaded attachments from Zendesk tickets.

By default, it will create a __Tickets__ folder in your Downloads, and it will put all attachments from the tickets into subfolders with tickets' IDs as their names.
It can be changed in options page (not much in terms of customization, Zendesk makes it extremely hard to parse anything from the tickets).
